# [Shop] CS: GO Glow Module

Allows you to set the glow effect on the player model

PS In addition to the glow, there is a ripple effect, too lazy to write a video.

This does have some bugs when it comes to custom models. Also you can see it through smoke but it might serve as a fun mod for you and your friends.
