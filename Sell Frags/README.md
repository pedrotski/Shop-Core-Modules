# [Shop] CS:GO Sell Frags Module 

The plugin provides an opportunity for players to sell their kills, and get credits in the SHOP !
To sell credits, just enter the command ! Frags in the chat, or sm_frags in the console.

The plugin was tested only on CS: S but should work on CS: GO as well, because the plugin has not many requirements.
The price of frags is 5 credits per kill, change the line new shop_value = (number) in the source ;
if needed.
