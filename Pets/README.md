# [Shop] CS:GO Pets Edition Module 

Allows you to buy pets in the shop that walk near you.
This version of the plugin has been improved to its normal state.

New features:
1. Hide pets in the shop.
2. Put your pet selling price in the shop.
3. Enable / Disable pet drop out of luck.
4. Indicate the duration of the use of the pet.
5. Provide a description for the pet .
6. Choose skins for pets (if the skin has them).
7. Increase or decrease the size of the pet.
8. Enable / Disable the animation of the pet when the player spawns.
9. If the player is AFCmore than 10-50 seconds - the pet starts to move (the waiting animation turns on automatically. Later, I think I'll improve it so that it is possible to cram my animations - Let's say how: the pet is playing, etc. if any)
